WATCH and BAD are scored as if taken: entry at the flag breakout, stop at invalidation, TP1 at the measured move. Counterfactual only: never counted in the 30-plan target or the expectancy above.


GOOD calls come from the engine's 1-minute alert log since 2026-09-25; before that from 10-minute captures.

## Net floor · NF (live since 2026-09-27)

_provisional; not evidence of an edge_

| Rule | Calls | Calls / day | Fills | Win rate | Exp. (gross R) | Net exp. (dir-cost) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Live | 29 | 0.64 | 29 | 25% | +0.06R | −2.25R |
| NF | 12 | 0.27 | 12 | 9.1% | −0.65R | −0.94R |

n=29 over 45.02 d (engine 0, backfill 29). NF (live since 2026-09-27): the same live ready calls, scored twice - Live with the plan's own stop, NF with the stop floored at max(0.5 x ATR(15m), 3 x round-trip cost: 0.34 % long / 0.14 % short), TP1 unchanged, taken only when gross >= 2.5R and net >= 1.0R. Net R charges the direction cost once per trade. Before 2026-09-27 (config 2026.09.24-5 and earlier) NF was a shadow comparator only, never traded; since config 2026.09.27-1 the floor is baked into the live plan itself, so Live IS the NF stop and the two columns converge going forward - historical divergence predates the cutover. Rows the engine could not source an NF verdict for are backfilled here (ATR from stored 15m candles, filled at the live ready close) - an approximation.

HTF-anchored entries ship live (docs/PROMPT_T20_HTF_ENTRY.md, owner decision 2026-09-27): direction from the 4h+1D EMA21/EMA200 stack, entry from a 1m/3m/5m flag reaching triggering, stop from the 1h swing (NF-floored, 3% scalp-capped), target from the last 1h impulse projected from that swing. Scored here from the 1-minute alert log, same math as RETEST_1H (mean/median/bootstrap 90% lower bound/max drawdown) for comparability — not a promotion gate; this class is already live.
